# Hybrid Chaining Model to Enhance Search Speed in Hashing

## Description
In this project, I implemented a **Hybrid Chaining Model** to improve the search speed of hashing. The model combines the use of **AVL trees** and the **SFML graphics library** to enhance the performance of hash tables in search operations.

The project involved:
- Creating an `AVL_table` class with methods for AVL tree insertion and search.
- Utilizing the **SFML graphics library** to visually represent the nodes of the AVL tree and the hash table.
- Implementing and evaluating the hybrid chaining model by displaying the hash table with its linked AVL tree.

### Goals:
The project aimed to improve the efficiency of search operations in hash tables by reducing collisions and enhancing data organization through the hybrid chaining model.

### Skills Learned:
- Hashing
- AVL trees
- SFML graphics library
